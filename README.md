<h1>Auflare Intelligence</h1>
<p>
    Auflare Intelligence is an Artificial Intelligence capable of understanding human intent, in order to provide concise information sourced from the internet.
    Auflare operates by locating a query based on the user's request, then searches a variety of search platforms for desired information. 
    Upon returning the data, the information is restructured within the server, then lastly presented to the user, in a concise format, though this is an exaggerated & simplified explanation.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, other than assisting with information, Auflare offers many other versatile features, such as understanding 
    the user's intent, sentiment, summarization, grammar correction, classification and extraction of important information from a user's input.
    Refer to the <a href="/docs">Documentation</a> for more information.
